Intro --> Thesis: Moving the OpenSSH daemon off of port 22 increases risk and cost, to little benefit.

Paragraph 1: Changing to a non-standard port does not decrease risk.

Paragraph 2: Changing to a non-standard port may increase risk.

Paragraph 3: Changing to a non-standard port increases cost.

Conclusion: Because it does not decrease risk, might increase risk, and definitely increases cost, switching the openssh service to another port is a bad idea.
